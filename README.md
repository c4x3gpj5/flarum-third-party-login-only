If you have any feedback, let us know! Do you experience issues? You can report issues on the Flarum Forum or on [GitHub](https://github.com/v17development/flarum-third-party-login-only).

> :warning: **Be careful**: This extension completely disables the Login and Registration forms.

##  ‚ÑπÔ∏è When to use this extension?
To be clear, this extension **does not add** oAuth to your Flarum instance but instead disables the `Sign In` and `Sign Up` password-forms for a better authenticating flow user experience. Use [FoF Passport](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/5203) or [FoF oAuth](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/25182) to add oAuth to your forum.

This extension is suitable for organizations or communities that only want to allow sign-in and sign-ups with external oAuth accounts/providers.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots

### Sign In window
After activating this extension, the sign in form is removed, only oAuth buttons are visible. The "Forgot password" link is only visible when a "Forgot password link" is set-up.

If the `Replace Sign In and Sign Up button` setting is enabled, the `Log in` window will not be visible and automatically opens the FoF Passport oAuth sign in window.
